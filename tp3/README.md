## Group T06G06

## TP 1 Notes

- On the first exercise we drew a rectangle triangle, a parallelogram and a diamond shapes.
- They were all made toggleable, the same thing was done for the second exercise.
- On the first figure drawn, the triangle, the direction of the points being drawn, let to it being drawn in the wrong axis, but it was fixed, the same concept was latter used for the parallelogram.
- On the second exercise we drew both small and large triangles.

## TP 2 Notes

- For the first exercise we drew a tangram based on the tangram assigned to us. We felt a bit of struggle figuring out how to change the figures in order to fit our tangram, also in the beginning there was some clipping between figures that was sorted out by trial and error.

-On the second exercise we drew the cube and placed it as the base for the tangram. The only part that was a bit more difficult was placing the cube in the exact place we wanted but it was nothing worrying.

-In the third exercise we drew another cube but this time using the class MyQuad, then placing it in the same spot has the previous cube.

## TP 3 Notes

- In the first exercise we reinstated the MyTangram and MyUnitCube then we added the normals of each object to the initBuffers() function starting with the cube and then the tangram. At this step we had some struggles with the activation of the normals in the tangram case and were helped by the monitor. Then we created a new material with similar color to wood and applied it to the cube.

Afterwards we created seven new materials to apply to each piece of the tangram, unfortunately we felt a bit lost trying to create the different colors but with a little trial and error we succeded.

- In the second exercise we are asked to create a prism in the MyPrism class, for this we copied the MyQuad file and then changed the way the vertices and indices were created so that we made the shape we wanted. The hardest part in this exercise was developing the normals for each vertice since with the addition of angles some more thinking was required but with time we were able find a solution.

- For the third exercise we create a cylinder by copying the prism file but then only changing the way the normals are created so that with lighting it gives more of a semblance of the circular shape that the cylinder possesses.
