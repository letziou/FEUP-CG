## Project Notes

- In the first picture we can observe our panorama. This was made possible because we sorrounded our field with a giean sphere where our normals were inverted to the inside of the sphere thus being able for us to see the light refleted inside of the sphere.

- To draw our bird we created several classes that draw different shapes. In MyBirdBodyTail we draw a cone, in MyBirdHead we draw a sphere, in MyBirdWing we draw a quadrilateral and in MyBirdTail we draw a triangle. 
- To make the bird a bird we use the functions of translation, rotation and scaling to build our bird in the MyBird.

- To draw the bird's nest we created a cilinder that has a base with small radius and the top has the opposite thus giving the feeling of a nest. In order to close the nest we applied a plane to the base to close the bottom.
- To draw the eggs we used the same sphere for the the panorama but now the normals are for the outside and the radius is much smaller, also to give the egg shape we scale only one of the three coordinates.
- In our scene we have 6 eggs through a small plane next to the bird's nest.
- When pressing the P button the bird will start to drop and then come back up. If an egg is near the vacinity of the bird it will be picked up and carried by it.
- If the bird is carrying an egg and is close to the nest, if the user presses the O button the egg will drop from the bird and land in the nest.
