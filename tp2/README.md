## Group T06G06

## TP 1 Notes

- On the first exercise we drew a rectangle triangle, a parallelogram and a diamond shapes.
- They were all made toggleable, the same thing was done for the second exercise.
- On the first figure drawn, the triangle, the direction of the points being drawn, let to it being drawn in the wrong axis, but it was fixed, the same concept was latter used for the parallelogram.
- On the second exercise we drew both small and large triangles.

## TP 2 Notes

- For the first exercise we drew a tangram based on the tangram assigned to us. We felt a bit of struggle figuring out how to change the figures in order to fit our tangram, also in the beginning there was some clipping between figures that was sorted out by trial and error.

-On the second exercise we drew the cube and placed it as the base for the tangram. The only part that was a bit more difficult was placing the cube in the exact place we wanted but it was nothing worrying.

-In the third exercise we drew another cube but this time using the class MyQuad, then placing it in the same spot has the previous cube.
